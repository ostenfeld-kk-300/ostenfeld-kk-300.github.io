                <h2>Bongostan's Constitution</h2>
                <p><strong>&sect; 1</strong> Bongostan is a wonderful country</p>
                <p><strong>&sect; 2</strong> Sparkling water for everyone</p>
                <p><strong>&sect; 3</strong> Bongostan's national flag must be visible throughout the national day</p>
                
                <h2>Bongostan's Penal Code</h2>
                <p><strong>&sect; 1.</strong> Under this provision, the conditions in subsections 1-8 can be punished with a penalty glass.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Subsection 1</strong> Empty Glass</li>
                    <li><strong>Subsection 2</strong> Passive behavior</li>
                    <li><strong>Subsection 3</strong> Insulting the Majesty</li>
                    <li><strong>Subsection 4</strong> Saying Cha.. or Ver.. instead of BONGO-WATER</li>

                <h2>Bongostan's National Dress Code</h2>
                <p>We hereby remind all citizens of the kingdom that hats and ties are mandatory at the annual banquet. Furthermore, a nice tie can lead to exile. Gentlemen are expected to wear shirts on the national day, and elephant orders will be awarded to citizens with pockets in their shirts. Girls, on the other hand, are expected to be low-cut, not necessarily to the navel, but around there. The common requirement for all is to wear headgear throughout the banquet.</p>
                
                <h2>Bongostan's Penal Execution Law</h2>
                <p><strong>&sect; 1.</strong> If a Bongostanian is sentenced to a penalty glass under the penal code section 1, subsections 1-8, the penalty is executed as follows:</p>
                <p>The glass is filled with BONGO-WATER, the nation counts down from 10 immediately after the penalty is issued, and the punished Bongostanian must within these 10 seconds empty the glass and refill it, without spilling or letting the bottle rest on the glass.</p>
                <p>If the penalty is not carried out, additional penalty glasses are imposed, where the above penal execution law is repeated, with a new national countdown.</p>
                <p><strong>THE WORD OF THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE IS LAW.</strong></p>
                <p><em>Thus, it is judged.</em></p>
